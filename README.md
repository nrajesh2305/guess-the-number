# Guess the Number

# How to Play:

The computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100. It is your duty to guess the number it is thinking of. If the guess is not the right answer, it provides you clues about if your guess is too high or too low. Be careful, you only have 10 lives!

Have fun using Guess the Number! :)
